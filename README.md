Exploring arduino as part of BCB 585

**Hardwhere**

* Raspberry Pi 4
* Arduino Uno
* SparkFun RedBoard
* Various Sensors

## Steps

1. Setup your Raspberry Pi 4 following instructions (link here)
2. Download VNC Viewer to connect Raspberry Pi to your computer (https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/)
3. Turn on ssh on your Raspberry Pi, and connect via VLC
4. Download Arudino IDE to your Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is like a separate computer so you'll need to connect it to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to interact with it. However, if you already have a laptop and none of the other peripherals, you'll need Remote Desktop Viewer (VNC or equivalent). 

Since Raspberry Pi only has digital input, you can connect an Arduino Uno to process and record analog input (moisture sensors, IR, etc).
